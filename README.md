# 📡 LangChain Network Assistant for OpenWrt

Conversational AI for your OpenWrt router, powered by LangChain.

This project brings the power of large language models to OpenWrt-based routers, enabling users to interact with their network through natural language. Ask questions, get status updates, or configure settings—all through a simple chat interface.
